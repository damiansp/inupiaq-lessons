Lessons for the Iñupiaq Langauge

At present this is just a collection of prototypes for lessons for the Iñupiaq (an Inuit or "Eskimo") language... hopefully to eventually
be developed into a full curriculum.  

The notecards are based on the textbook "North Slope Iñupiaq Grammar: First Year" by Edna Ahgeak MacLean, and she created the audio 
recordings, and aided in the proofreading of the data.  

The notecard section is copyright protected, but the remainder of the repo is under a Creative Commons Share Alike License.
